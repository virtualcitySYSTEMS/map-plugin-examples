# Weather Plugin

This is a demo plugin for the VC MAP. It creates rain or snow weather using Cesium Particle System.
It is based on this [Cesium Sandcastle Demo](https://sandcastle.cesium.com/?src=Particle%20System%20Weather.html)
and used in this [Tutorial](../../doc/VCM_Plugin_Tutorial.md) on VC MAP plugin development.

For more information on plugin development refer also to [VC MAP Plugin Docu](../../doc/VCM_Plugin.md)
